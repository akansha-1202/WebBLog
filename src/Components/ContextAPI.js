As Fighter shoot involves filming with real fighter jets, Hrithik has taken it upon himself to learn the processes and mechanisms involved with flying a real fighter jet. The actor began his training before the Assam schedule in November at Tezpur Airbase, before kick-starting the shoot for the first schedule, and continues to practice and brush up his knowledge while having shot for three schedules of the film.A source close to the project shared, “Hrithik chose to practise on a simulator and learn the buttons and the automated process to be able to confidently present himself onscreen. He started taking workshops since November and has continued simulator training to learn the nuances of playing a fighter jet pilot. While visiting the air base and the Air force training academy, he also spent time with the pilots and cadets to observe their demeanor and understand the way that they function. Hrithik possesses a curious mind and he asked a lot of questions and took notes from the conversations he had with these officials. He is an actor who goes through lengths to deliver his best for his films. Fighter also has glimpses of Hrithik character boxing and even for that one scene, he trained for days to get his posture right. Such is his dedication to acting, he truly enjoys being an actor and that evident to all of us on sets.”Donning the uniform of an Air Force officer, Hrithik Roshan is currently shooting schedules of Fighter which is touted as India’s first aerial action film. Marking his third outing with director Siddharth Anand after Bang Bang and War, Fighter also brings together Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone for the first time.Scheduled to release in January 2024, Fighter portrays Hrithik Roshan as a fighter jet pilot for the first time on screen, tracing his journey from a young cadet in training to India’s best fighter pilot.',

Aamir has now been earning praise for how he did not mind being mocked for Laal Singh Chaddha failure in one of the ads. Producer Atul Kasbekar took to his Twitter handle and commented on the ad. He wrote, ‘Quite enjoying the dream 11 adverts with #AamirKhan and various cricketers. To green light scripts with self deprecating humour is rare with most superstars. It actually ends up being a superpower. Endears one to an audience if you can take a joke on yourself. Well done.’While one user wrote, ‘Aamir Khan’s Dream 11 ads are good. He is making fun of his own failures for e.g. Laal Singh Chaddha. How sporty, not many in Bollywood are that sporty you know’, another one added, ‘Dream 11 ads. Btw the way Aamir Khan took his success & failures so sportingly. No matter whether its in ad or any show he talks or jokes abt his mistakes so spontaneously.

However, the humungous success of the Shah Rukh Khan starrer has further given wings to this spy universe and take it to another level. Hence, as per reports, Chopra attention has shifted from 'Dhoom 4' now.'Dhoom 4' seems to have taken a backseat now with 'Pathaan Vs Tiger' and 'War 2' as per a report in Peepingmoon.com. The report also suggested that at the moment, their attention is completely on the Spy universe, after the success of 'Pathaan'. However, Chopra wants to continue the 'Dhoom' series and it's been written since years but the team hasn't come up with an ideal storyline yet. Hence, the fourth installment of the franchise has taken backseat at the moment.Apparently, Aamir Khan has been keenly interested in being a part of 'Dhoom 4' and wants to make it happen, but Yash Raj Films wants to cast a young actor. The report also said that Ranbir Kapoor hasn't been approached for the film because as per a source, the script is not yet finalised and nothing seems to be happening till the end of 2024.Post 'Pathaan', Chopra is now gearing up for the release of 'Tiger 3' this Diwali. The film stars Katrina Kaif, Salman Khan and Emraan Hashmi. SRK is also touted to have a cameo in the film.",

          content:"he covid-19 pandemic brought a significant change in the viewing pattern of the audience. Sadly, it did dent Bollywood to a large extent, and there has been a sudden rise in the craze of Hindi dubbed versions of South Indian films. So today, we’ll be taking a look at a fun comparison between successful films of Bollywood and successful Hindi dubbed South films at the Indian box office in the post Covide era. On one side, there’s a 500 crore monster like Pathaan; on the other, there’s KGF Chapter 2’s juggernaut!Before we get started, please note that we’ll be considering films with verdicts of Hit, Super-Hit and Super-Duper Hit as per Koimoi’s box office parameters. After mentioning the films separately, collections will be combined for a comparison between Bollywood and Hindi dubbed versions of South Indian films (inclusive of Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam).As per the filtered list, we got 5 films from the South which managed to get higher verdicts at the Indian box office. Pushpa earned a lifetime of 106 crores with its Hindi version. Karthikeya 2 (Hindi) did a business of 30 crores. KGF Chapter 2 and RRR earned massively with their Hindi dubbed versions by ending their lifetime at 434.62 crores and 277 crores, respectively. Kantara (Hindi) is the final name on the list, earning 81.10 crores. The combined collection stands at 928.72 crores.Now coming to Bollywood, there are 4 films in total with higher verdicts. The Kashmir Files is the first mega success from Bollywood in the post-Covid era. It earned 252.50 crores. Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 did a business of 185.57 crores, while Drishyam 2 earned 241 crores. Pathaan smashed all the records and earned 543.22 crores. The combined collection from Bollywood stands at 1222.29 crores.Bollywood vs Hindi Dubbed Versions Of South Films, One can clearly see that Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan greatly boosted Bollywood when it was much needed to stand against the wave of South dubbed films!",

          content:'Vikram Vedha is the Hindi remake of the 2017 Tamil movie of the same name starring R Madhavan and Vijay Setupathi. Starring Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan in lead roles, it debuted in theatres on Sep 30, 2022. Despite huge anticipation, Vikram Vedha tanked at the box office. The movie has flopped at the box office and the makers have now locked the OTT release date. Here’s everything you need to know about the OTT release of Vikram Vedha.Vikram Vedha is produced by Jio Studios. If we look at the poster of the movie, it is clear that Vikram Vedha will stream on Voot Select and Jio Cinema.Now, coming to the release date, there is no official announcement made by the producers yet. Earlier, it was reported that the OTT premiere date would depend on how the movie performs in theatres. If it’s a blockbuster, it will have an extended run in theatres and thus delay the OTT release.Since the movie failed at the box office, our calculated guess regarding the OTT premiere was about 5 to 6 weeks after theatrical release. However, even six months after its theatrical release, there is no update on Vikram Vedha’s OTT release.As per the latest update and Telechakkar report, Vikram Vedha will premiere on the updated Jio Cinema app on May 8, 2023. It is the same app where IPL 2023 matches are streaming.The neo-noir action thriller is inspired by the Indian folktale ‘Betaal Pachisi’, and it follows the tale of Vikram, a police officer who sets out to find and kill the criminal Vedha. After Vedha willingly surrenders himself, he tells Vikram three stories that change his views of good and evil.',

          content:"1. Panchayat : Season 2 of Panchayat takes us back to Phulera, as Panchayat Secretary Abhishek Tripathi continues to struggle between feeling at home and wanting more for himself. The cast — led by Jitendra Kumar, Neena Gupta, Raghubir Yadav, Chandan Roy, and Faisal Malik — touch upon slightly more serious, emotional themes this season, and pull it off, while maintaining the show's gentle comedy.2. Delhi Crime : Season 1 of Delhi Crime, based on the Nirbhaya case, released in 2019. While a difficult watch, the gritty procedural was an instant success. Released in 2022, Season 2, detailing a series of gruesome home invasions, is no different. In five fast-paced episodes, we go back into the world of Delhi crime and Delhi police, made very real by the standout cast, led by Shefali Shah.3. Rocket Boys : Based on the lives of Dr. Homi J. Bhabha and Dr. Vikram Sarabhai,Rocket Boys is a fascinating peek into India's formative years in the field of aeronautics. Jim Sarbh and Ishwak Singh's easy camaraderie translates well on screen and doesn't let the show drag. To lend authenticity to the story, classical dancer Mallika Sarabhai, Vikram Sarabhai's daughter, was consulted for information about their home and lifestyle.4. Human : If you've ever wondered how unethical and dangerous the business of saving lives can be, Human, a show about the dark side of Indian pharma, has the answer for you. The gripping psychological thriller will compel you to binge-watch the full season, especially with Shefali Shah's portrayal of a ruthless pharma boss.5. Apharan : Much like the first season, the second season of Apharan fully embraces its over-the-top, weird world and doesn't give the very aptly cast Arunoday Singh time to breathe. There's suspense, action, that kitschy '70s vibe, and so much more that keeps fans hooked through the 11-episode run.6. Gullak : In its third season, Gullak continued to charm fans with its disarming portrayal of the middle-class Mishra family and their problems, so relatable that for many it's almost like watching their own parents and siblings on screen. In five crisp episodes, Jameel Khan, Geetanjali Kulkarni, Vaibhav Raj Gupta, and Harsh Mayar prove yet again that ordinary is not always boring.7. NCR Days : Not your average college show, NCR Days is the story of Monu, played by Nikhil Vijay, who comes to NCR from Jodhpur for an MBA, primarily so he can marry his girlfriend back home. In his journey of growing, changing, and finding himself, he makes new friends and learns some hard lessons. Writer-director Ambrish Verma doesn't just create a rich, complex world in only five episodes, but also plays a central character in the show.8. Abhay : Season 3 of Abhay continues to follow UP Police SP Abhay Pratap Singh (played by Kunal Kemmu) as he battles personal demons and solves gruesome crimes. This season differs from earlier seasons in that it pits him against one central villain — a charismatic cult leader planning mass murder, played to perfection by Vijay Raaz. Kunal's performance keeps you rooting for Abhay through some very tumultuous times.9. Campus Diaries : Featuring some very popular content creators, like Harsh Beniwal and Saloni Gaur, Campus Diaries tells the coming-of-age stories of six students at Excel University. They navigate love, life, and all the angst and challenges that come with learning how to be an adult in the real world.10. College Romance : A quintessential new-adult rom-com, College Romance continued to be a hit with fans as Season 3 released in 2022. In just five easy-to-binge episodes, love and friendship are tested amidst scandals and long-distance relationships. So, if you're not in college anymore, get ready to miss the good ol' days!",

          content:'The ‘John Wick’ series has been clear and precise in its offering, and Chapter 4, aka JW4, is no different in its premise. It builds on what the franchise has become synonymous with – high-octane, dazzling fight choreography and close-quarter combat featuring Keanu Reeves doing what he does best. But JW4 turns it all up a notch, expanding the mythos of the High Table with old players, featuring Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and the late Lance Reddick, but also introduces a mix of new characters who are all instantly memorable.Scott Adkins is virtually unrecognisable yet thoroughly enjoyable as Killa – a scenery-chewing villain plucked straight out of a James Bond movie. Donnie Yen often steals the show as Caine with his clean and crisp artistry, which warrants his own spin-off. Adding to the list of martial art legends are Hiroyuki Sanada and Marko Zaror, whose distinctive styles are hard to miss. Bill Skarsgård is menacingly measured as Marquis – a stylish baddie begging to be dispatched in the most brutal way. A wildcard thrown into the mix is Shamier Anderson’s mysterious Mr Nobody with his feisty canine companion. Rina Sawayama makes her film debut with some standout sequences of her own. However, the film rests on Keanu Reeves’ stoic shoulders, and his actions continue to speak louder than words with a relentless commitment to up the ante. This high-calibre roster allows elaborately choreographed fight sequences to be presented in wide frames without fast-paced cuts. The results are breathtaking, with scenes shot inventively to often make JW4 play out like a live-action video game, perfectly capturing this franchise tone and feel. Director Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves have been pushing for more acknowledgement of stunt work in film. JW4’s remarkable stunt performers pull off innumerable jaw-dropping moments, presenting a showcase of their invaluable contribution to the entertainment industry. If the first John Wick film raised the bar for the spectacle of fight-based storytelling while reinforcing Keanu Reeves as a bona fide action star, JW4 redefines the gold standard for the genre.',

          content:'Dame Mary Quant, the iconic fashion designer who invented and popularized the miniskirt, has died. Mary’s family released a statement revealing that she died “peacefully at home” in England on Thursday, April 13. Her family called her “one of the most internationally recognized fashion designers of the 20th Century and an outstanding innovator of the Swinging Sixties,” according to CNN.Mary helped shape a new era in British fashion in the 1960s, when she invented the miniskirt that is still worn today. Mary solidified herself as a fashion icon whose contributions have never gone unnoticed. Learn more about Mary below.Mary began her fashion career when she and her husband opened a boutique called Bazaar in Kings Road in 1955. She started designing her own clothes, for both men and women, that were sold at her store. Mary’s store was a huge success and she started exporting her clothes to the United States, according to ABC News.Ironically, Mary was not allowed to study fashion in college. Her parents, Jack and Mildred Quant, were both from mining families, and refused to let Mary pursue a career in fashion. Instead, Mary studied illustration and art education at Goldsmiths College in London. After graduating, Mary decided to start working in the fashion industry, which led her down the path that changed her life forever.',

          content:'BLACKPINK, as of this writing, is the most successful K-pop girl group of all time, and they have a myriad of accolades to prove it. For instance, just in 2018 — two years after the group debuted (and became the first K-pop girl group to chart on the Canadian Hot 100 chart) — they picked up three charting milestones on the Billboard charts, per Billboard. First, they earned the “highest-charting hit ever by a K-pop girl group” on the Billboard Hot 100 with their single “Ddu-Du Ddu-Du.” Secondly, their second EP, Square Up, debuted at No. 40 and became “the highest charting album by an all-female K-pop group at the time.” Lastly, they became the first female K-pop group to debut at the top of the Emerging Artists chart — and that’s just the beginning of it.BLACKPINK also beat out BTS to earn three Guinness World Records after they dropped the video for “How You Like That” in June 2020. The video became the most-viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours, the most-viewed music video on the platform in 24 hours, and the most-viewed music video by a K-pop group in 24 hours.

Luckily, due to quick action and great care, he is already on his way to recovery.”Sources for TMZ with “direct knowledge” reportedly told the outlet that the issue was serious enough for the Oscar winning actor to be hospitalized on Tuesday. Few other details were immediately available, but the family asked for privacy. “We know how beloved he is and appreciate your prayers,” the statement continued. “The family asks for privacy during this time. Much love, the Foxx family.” Comments were turned off on the post.Jamie, 55, is known for his robust roles in high profile films, and achieved the highest honor in the entertainment industry in 2005 for the Ray Charles biopic Ray — a Best Actor Academy Award. But in a 2018 interview with Hip Hop Hollywood, the talented actor admitted to struggling with depression and substance abuse over the years — even referencing rapper Kanye West, as he has admitted to dealing with similar issues.When [Kanye] talked about the drugs, the mental drugs, I’ve had an episode of that,’ he said at the time. ‘When [Kanye] was talking about the, “I went in for two pills, and then seven pills [he received from the hospital],’ that’s real!’”  Jamie, who is known for a long term, extremely low-key romance with Katie Holmes, also said his mental health issues started early in life — and they continued as he aged into maturity.',

          content:'Coachella is almost here! The three-day/two weekend festival takes place from April 14-16 and 21-23, making Indio, California, the center of the music world. The 2023 lineup lives up to that moniker, with international headliners Bad Bunny, BLACKPINK, and Frank Ocean bringing diverse sounds and spirits to the stage. The lineup itself includes artists from all over the globe, leading some to wonder if this might be the best Coachella yet. Either way, expect the festival to be a destination for some of the biggest celebrities, influencers, and music fans out there. (It’s also become quite a fashion event, with “Coachella” being a genre all to itself.)The festival also dropped a surprise ahead of the first weekend: blink-182 will be playing, kicking off their reunion — Tom deLonge returned to the group alongside Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker — on Friday. The band will play the Sahara tent at the festival Friday from 6:45-7:35 p.m. PST, with Metro Boomin closing out the night on that stage starting at 10:35 p.m.The 2023 lineup has some familiar faces and some newcomers (and Calvin Harris, who will be DJing all weekend). But, there’s bound to be one or two people going “Who?” when they look at the artists scheduled to play. So, HollywoodLife has put together a rundown of the Coachella weekends, including a brief description of the artists playing. Set time for these weekends will be released closer to the date, so before you know when they’re playing, find out which stars will make your weekend one to remember.',

This includes re-release sales.Cameron has made no secret of the fact that he needed the film, titled Avatar: The Way of Water, to be a huge success – especially considering there are four sequels in the works.While the director claimed that the film needed to become the fifth highest-grossing film of all time to break even, Variety reported that he was embellishing and that the release would begin to make a profit once it hit an international gross of $1.5bn (£1.264bn).However, extraordinarily, this feat is not far off – after just 23 days, it has become the 10th biggest film of all time.On Thursday (5 January), the film’s box office total sat at $1.516bn (£1.278bn).With the latest profits added, the film has sailed past Top Gun: Maverick, which was the biggest film released in 2022. That feat now officially belongs to the Avatar 2.If the film’s success continues, which it seems likely to do, the film will carry on up the list of biggest films ever to become one of the five highest-grossing releases of all time.This means that Cameron’s films would account for three of the top five alongside the first Avatar and Titanic (1997).Currently rounding out the top five are Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers Endgame, which were released in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.',

          content:'We have entered an era where the threat of AI taking over some jobs in the near future is looking very real. Thanks to the significant progress made in the field of generative AI over the past couple of years, computers can now write, draw, and code on their own. And with new tools emerging almost every day, the technology is only improving.One such tool doing rounds on the internet is PassGAN. Featured in a new report published by a cybersecurity firm called Home Security Heroes, the AI-based password-cracking tool uses machine learning to generate password guesses – and it’s already causing a panic due to abilities that appear extremely impressive.However, while articles on the web may lead you to believe that PassGAN is some new scary tool that employs ChatGPT-like powers to guess passwords, that could not be further from the truth. Read on to know more.Unlike conventional methods of password cracking such as a combinator attack and the brute force method, PassGAN creates a neural network that attempts to train machines to analyse and interpret data similar to how a human brain would.It works by first learning the distribution of real passwords from actual password leaks, and then generating new passwords that are similar to the ones it has learned. By doing so, it can quickly crack passwords that are common or predictable.A recent study by cybersecurity firm Home Security Heroes tested PassGAN’s abilities on a list of over 15 million passwords. The results were alarming: PassGAN could crack 51% of common passwords in under a minute, 61% in an hour, 71% in a day, and 81% in a month.The study also found that passwords with up to 7 characters, even if they have symbols and numbers, can be cracked in under 6 minutes. However, with each subsequent increase in password length, PassGAN grows exponentially slower. For example, passwords with more than 18 characters would take the AI tool billions of years to crack.',

          content:'WhatsApp is launching new security features to further protect users’ privacy and security. In a press release, the company announced new account protection features for when you switch to another device, new device verification checks, and a feature that lets you verify that you have a secure connection.WhatsApp will now double-check if it’s really you when you switch to a new device with a new feature designed to block unauthorised account transfers. The messaging app may now ask users to verify their identity on their old device before they can switch their account to a new device. This extra security check aims to prevent hackers from hijacking WhatsApp accounts and accessing personal chats and data.While users previously had to verify encryption by scanning a QR code when in person and by sharing a unique 60-digit code if remote, WhatsApp is now introducing a new cryptographic security feature to automatically verify a secure connection without the need for this long code.It’s based on a process that automatically checks the security codes of the contacts and confirms that they match. Users can access this feature by tapping on the encryption tab under a contact’s info and see if their conversation is secure.Citing how malware is used to advance account takeover (ATO) attacks that send messages without the user’s consent, WhatsApp says it’s added checks to help authenticate your account. The platform says that no action will be needed from the user end, but that the app will “better protect you if your device is compromised.”WhatsApp says that these 3 features are only a few of the additional security features the platform will gain in the coming months and that it looks forward to announcing more updates soon.This announcement comes after the launch of the “Stay Safe with WhatsApp” campaign launched by the platform on Wednesday. It aims to raise awareness about the various safety features pre-built into the messaging app.',

          description:'In a discovery that happened almost by accident, researchers at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada were able to detect antineutrinos from a nearby nuclear plant using ultrapure water.',
          content:'In a lab buried around 2000 kilometres under the ground in Canada, scientists accidentally discovered antineutrinos using extremely pure water for the first time.Antineutrinos are the antimatter of neutrinos. They have an almost non-existent mass and charge and they rarely if ever interact with other particles. This makes them especially difficult to detect. They are produced as a byproduct when neutrons separate into protons and electrons in nuclear reactors.The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO)was being upgraded to make it SNO+ when the discovery was made. The scientists detected the antineutrino even before the observatory’s upgrades were completed.As the observatory’s detector’s components were being upgraded in 2018, the observatory was filled with ultrapure water, and the detector was being calibrated. While looking through the calibration data, the researchers picked up signals of an antineutrino that came from a nuclear power station hundreds of kilometres away.“It intrigues us that pure water can be used to measure antineutrinos from reactors and at such large distances. We spent significant effort to extract a handful of signals from 190 days of data,” Lebanowski said. The result is gratifying,” said SNO+ collaborator Logan Lebanowski in a press statement.Usually, in order to detect antineutrinos, “liquid scintillators” scientists need to use a method called liquid scintillation. Typically, this involves the use of chemicals like linear alkybenzene.But this new discovery suggests that it would be possible to build neutrino detectors using ultrapure water, which is non-toxic, relatively inexpensive and easy to handle. This could mean that detectors such as SNO+ could be used to monitor the power output of a nuclear plant from a distance.',

If you search for a hotel and tap on the view more button, Google will let you explore the property in what it calls a swipeable story format where you can go through the photos of the hotel so you know what it looks like.Explore more Google is also making it easier to find more things to do when you are travelling to a new place. If you are visiting a popular place or want to go to some other place, searching for an attraction or tour company will directly show the price associated along with a link that lets you book a ticket.Save money on flight tickets As it turns out, Google is also working to make it easy for users to save money on their next flight. Currently available as a pilot program for price guarantees in the United States, if users see a flight with the price guarantee badge, it means the price for the flight wont go any lower.The tech giant says that if the price goes down than what the badge mentioned, the company will pay the user the difference amount via Google Pay. However, the program is only available for those flight bookings made from Google on flights that depart from the United States.',

In terms of hardware, the Apple Reality Pro could easily be the most powerful consumer-grade virtual-reality headset, which is said to run on a custom rOS, powered by a custom Apple Silicon.The device is said to weigh between 300 to 400 grams, and is likely to pack two high-resolution OLED eyepieces, possibly with 4K resolution per eye along with a plethora of sensors for eye and head tracking. This is said to be a standalone device. However, users might have to pair it with an iPhone to configure and control it.With all the cutting-edge technology, the Apple Reality Pro is also said to be on the expensive side. Leaks suggest that Apples first AR/VR headset could cost as much as $3,000 or Rs 2,50,000. Apple Mac Pro The Mac Pro is the only computer that Apple currently sells with an Intel CPU, and the company is expected to complete the Intel-Apple Silicon transition by announcing the Apple Silicon-powered Mac Pro, which will be the most powerful Mac that the company has ever launched.15-inch MacBook Air Apple is also expected to announce its first 15-inch MacBook Air at WWDC 2023. Again, the design and the form factor of the upcoming MacBook Air could have a similar design while the 15-inch model will have a slightly larger form factor. Similarly, it is also said to feature the next-generation Apple Silicon M3 processor, which is said to be more powerful and power efficient. In terms of pricing, the 15-inch MacBook Air is likely to sit between the 13-inch MacBook Air and the 14-inch MacBook Pro.New iMacs Apple is also expected to announce the refreshed version of the iMac, possibly with M2/M3 chip at WWDC 2023.

On being asked her favourite Gujarati food, she replied, “Khandvi and dal dhokli.” Posting a picture of homemade khandvi, the actor wrote, “I made this plate of khandvi myself. My mom loves it, so, learned to make it for her.”For the unversed, khandvi is a popular Gujarati snack made from a mixture of gram flour, yoghurt, and spices. The mixture is spread out on a flat surface, rolled into thin layers, and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Khandvi is known for its unique texture, which is soft, silky, and smooth. Dal Dhokli, on the other hand, is a one-pot dish which is made by simmering bite-sized pieces of whole wheat flour dough (dhokli) in a spicy lentil stew (dal) until they are cooked through and tender. The dal is typically made with pigeon peas (toor dal) but can also be made with other lentils such as split green gram (moong dal) or split yellow gram (chana dal).',

But the chance to promote Italian excellence is a valuable one, she added.Italy’s olive oil producers’ association, ASSITOL, welcomed “the daring innovation,” saying the line of drinks could ”relaunch the image of olive oil, especially among young people.” The association has been promoting adding olive oil to cocktails.',

          content:'During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims around the world fast from dawn to dusk. As such, to stay active and energetic throughout the day while fasting, it is important to eat healthy and nutritious food during sehri (pre-dawn meal) and iftar (meal eaten at dusk while breaking fast). So, if you have been scouting for recipes to break or begin your fast with, celebrity fitness expert Yasmin Karachiwala has an easy, delicious, and nutritious chia pudding recipe that you can easily whip up for sehri.“Ramadan Kareem everyone! We are constantly struggling with what to eat for sehri. So today, I’m going to share with you my favourite go-to — chia pudding. It’s packed with essential nutrients to keep you feeling full and satisfied throughout the day,” Karichawala wrote in an Instagram post, as she shared the nutritious recipe.Add ½ cup milk of choice and ½ cup mangoes to a blender. Blend until smooth Add blueberry mix along with 2 tbsp chia seeds, 2 tsp maple syrup , and ½ tsp vanilla extract to a mason jar Mix together and let sit in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours, but preferably overnight.Stir together, then add toppings like plain Greek yoghurt and fresh mango slices Enjoy!Chia pudding can be a great option for suhoor, as it is high in fiber, protein, and healthy fats. Speaking with indianexpress.com, Sameena Ansari – Senior Dietitian and Nutritionist, CARE Hospitals, Hi-Tec City, Hyderabad, said: “The fiber and protein in chia seeds can help to keep you feeling full and satisfied throughout the day, which can be especially helpful during Ramadan, when meals are limited. Chia seeds are also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation and support overall health”.*Chia seeds absorb a lot of liquid, so it is important to use the right ratio of chia seeds to liquid to avoid a clumpy or dry texture.*Chia seeds can be a choking hazard if not properly soaked and hydrated, so consume them carefully.While chia pudding can be a healthy addition to your suhoor meal, it is important to balance it with other nutritious foods to ensure that you are getting all of the nutrients that your body needs.',

          content:'Without even knowing it, you have probably grown up with the sound of coffee grinding. Think about the coffee aisle in the supermarket, where large industrial grinders take whole beans and divvy them into small pieces. The practice of coffee grinding is so ubiquitous that it is even a bonus task on the television show Supermarket Sweep — both the original show and the newly rebooted version. Contestants can patiently grind a bag of coffee for extra cash. Grinding coffee is an essential step in the brewing process, and with so many affordable options, it is a step you should consider taking out of the supermarket and into your home. Like many things at the supermarket, coffee is a food item that begins to get stale sooner if you grind it ahead of time. Grinding at home will allow you to enjoy the freshest, tastiest version of your favorite brew. Here is everything you need to know about how to grind for any situation.Grinding makes coffee particles small enough so that when you pour water, it can extract flavor. If you simply throw whole beans into your coffee brewer, you will end up with slightly coffee-flavored water, because the water can not penetrate the beans and find all the good-tasting stuff we are looking for. Grind size ultimately impacts how water flows through the coffee bed, the corresponding extraction rate, and thus the final taste of the coffee you have brewed, says Sierra Yeo, the 2022 UK Brewers Cup Champion. Simply put, grinding coffee changes the available surface area for water to interact with coffee. The more surface area, the more water can mingle with, and pull flavor from, beans. Blade grinders: Blade grinders have a propellor-like blade, usually powered by a motor, that chops coffee into smaller pieces. However, blade grinders are notorious for chopping coffee unevenly, creating particles of all sizes. If you grind coffee with a blade grinder, you sort of never know what you are going to get: you might have particles that are dust-like in size, and others that look like giant boulders (sometimes a bean or two might even escape the blade, and not be chopped at all).

          content:'Raghavan Iyer, who left India for the United States as a young man clueless about how to cook even a simple potato curry and went on to teach America’s heartland how to prepare one of the world’s most complex cuisines, died on Friday in San Francisco. He was 61.The cause was pneumonia complicated by colorectal cancer that had metastasized to his lungs and brain, said Terry Erickson, his partner of 41 years. Mr. Iyer lived in Minneapolis and was visiting San Francisco at his death.Mr. Erickson was one of the first people Mr. Iyer met when he arrived in Minnesota from Mumbai at 21 to attend a small but well-regarded hospitality management program. He had picked it because it was the least expensive one he could find in America.“When I first got to this country, I was almost embarrassed about where I was from and the food we ate,” he said in an interview with The New York Times in February. After a while, he said, he realized that his culture was the “tool” he could use to overcome feelings of inferiority.Mr. Iyer parlayed a rascally charm and a palate imprinted by the vegetarian South Indian food of his childhood into a prolific career, one built in part on the cookbooks of Madhur Jaffrey and Julie Sahni, the Indian cooking heavyweights who began their culinary careers in the 1970s. He referred to them as “the grandes dames of Indian cooking.”His contributions were a bridge to a new breed of American cooks and cookbook authors from the Indian diaspora, like Nik Sharma and Asha Gomez, who broke with classic preparations and found success playing with ingredients — swapping feta for the Indian cheese paneer, for example, or replacing the crust of a pizza with naan.Mr. Iyer consulted for restaurants around the country, taught countless workshops, led tours to India, created a line of frozen Indian meals for Target and instructed thousands of professional cooks at universities, museums and companies, including Google.But his favorite thing was helping individual cooks confidently tackle dishes like curries and biryanis, often using basic ingredients that are common in supermarkets.Mr. Iyer published “Betty Crocker’s Indian Home Cooking,” the first of his seven books, in 2001. The Betty Crocker company hadn’t been in the market for an Indian cookbook, but Mr. Iyer kept pressing an editor he knew at General Mills, Betty Crocker’s corporate parent, with headquarters in Minneapolis.Betty Crocker eventually let him cook a multicourse Indian lunch for a collection of executives and book publishers. It was a spectacular success. Afterward, he asked, “Is Betty ready for Indian?” The book went on to be a hit.',

Which is why we decided to reach out to the artists who created the actor’s tattoos.Recalling their first sitting for the tattoos, Micky recollected, “We had brought quite a few references, basis the description given to us about John’s character in the film.

          content:'Exercise not only helps you control weight and combat health issues but is also a great mood elevator. As such, exercising regularly gives a boost to your self-esteem and makes you feel better. However, many of us do not find the time or motivation to exercise daily. But the good news is that, as per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity activity is enough to keep you healthy and fit. That comes around to approximately 10 to 11 minutes per day, not too bad, right?For this, we have got the perfect workout routine that you can do anywhere at any time. Here is the 10-minute workout routine by celebrity fitness instructor, Yasmin Karachiwala, to make you glow from the inside out.A plank pose, or Kumbhakasana, is one of the foundational poses in yoga. A high plank roll is a variation to the traditional plank pose. Singh said, “It provides stability and strength to the core muscles, which contain your oblique, lower back, and all of the side muscles. This exercise will also help enhance your twisting stability.To perform this move, go down on your fours. Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders with your back and legs aligned in a straight line. Contract your abs and rotate and pivot towards the right. Press your hands while knocking your feet on the other side. Repeat this with the other leg as well.“Reverse lunges are an excellent way to work your hamstrings, glutes, calves and quads, while providing you with lower body strength,” said Singh. It is a great option for beginners as it is easy to control the backward motion.First, stand shoulder-width apart. Then, inhale and carefully take a big step backwards with your right foot as you bend both knees to 90 degrees, making sure your weight is distributed evenly between both legs. Now, exhale and extend both knees while transferring your weight onto your left foot. At the same time, raise your right foot to bring your knee near your chest. Lower your right leg to the starting position. Repeat this on the other side.Squats are one of the main movement patterns humans use in their daily life– we perform it every time we sit down and get up from a chair. Singh said this movement helps strengthen lateral muscles. He added that it is beneficial for people who play sports like football and lawn tennis. “The side-to-side squats activate several muscle groups simultaneously, working the legs, glutes, and core. The squat increases performance and flexibility and the side-to-side movement improves dynamic balance and agility,” he added.To do this exercise, start with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands in front holding each other. Then, start to hinge at the hips and bend your knees slightly. Ensure that your back is straight up. Now, push your leg to one side and bend your other knee. Bring the leg back so that both of them are together. Then, repeat the process to the other side.',

          content:'Getting in the habit of exercising isn’t easy. Not only is finding the time to exercise a major deterrent for people, the fear of aches, pain and injuries is also a reason that people put off starting a new exercise regime.But exercise doesn’t necessarily have to lead to pain or injuries. Here are some simple things you can do to avoid these when starting out.It’s important to warm up before your exercise. Warming up raises the temperature of the working muscles and the whole body. It also prepares your body for the increased stress of exercise. Muscles that have been warmed up are able to exercise for longer, and suffer less soreness and reduced injury risk.Exactly what constitutes an effective warm-up varies from workout to workout. But in general, you should dedicate at least five to ten minutes of your workout to warming up. Start with large, whole-body movements such as body-weight squats and lunges before progressing to more task-specific actions – such as a walk or jog before running, or lifting light weights before weight training. Your warm-up shouldn’t be too strenuous. Aim to use only about 40-60% of your maximum effort.A common mistake when starting a new exercise regime is to do too much. This can lead to pain after workouts, and may also increase your likelihood of injury.When you first begin a new workout plan, it’s important to start gradually and at your own pace. Since everyone is different, avoid following an exercise programme that uses absolute distances or repetitions. Instead, focus on how you feel during a workout and listen to what your body is telling youIt can take weeks or even months to notice the benefits of exercise, so don’t expect to see your health and fitness improve overnight. It’s also worth noting that progress isn’t always linear – some days you may find it’s difficult to exercise as long or as hard as you did the previous session. Listen to your body and stop when you feel tired, to avoid injury.',

          content:'Anil Kapoor, who is known for his dedication to fitness, recently took to Instagram to share a glimpse of his rigorous workout regime as he prepares for his next film Fighter, which will also star Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone in leading roles.But it was no ordinary workout. In the picture, the actor was seen sweating it out on the treadmill while wearing an oxygen mask. In another post, he was seen outside a cryo chamber, probably after a cryotherapy session. As expected, the 66-year-old was praised by his friends and co-stars in the film industry for his commitment to fitness.In simple words, exercising with an oxygen mask is known as oxygen therapy, and it can be a great way to reduce the physical stress of exercise. Explaining further, Utsav Agrawal, Fitness Coach at FITTR told indianexpress.com, “Oxygen therapy during exercise is typically used for individuals with respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), that affect the lungs’ ability to absorb oxygen. Using an oxygen mask, in such cases, can help improve oxygen delivery to the body and reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness. It may also improve exercise capacity and endurance.”He explained that during exercise, the body uses a lot more oxygen and requires fast replenishment. “In response, your heart rate and breathing rate increase to transport more oxygen to your muscles and surrounding tissues. And if you have low oxygen levels in your blood, this puts additional stress on your heart. Additionally, breathing pure oxygen while you exercise also saturates blood more effectively into the body’s tissues, blood vessels and organs. With increased circulation and saturation your body can heal from injuries faster,” he said.',

But did you know drinking plain water may not really be the best way to beat dehydration? It’s not us, but Cory Rodriguez, a health and wellness expert, said so in a video: “Plain water is not the best way to hydrate”. He continued that while he used to drink up to a gallon of water per day (it was too much), he never replenished electrolytes. “This meant I spent my day peeing and constantly flushing out these essential minerals,” he added.What are electrolytes? Electrolytes are basically minerals like potassium, calcium, and magnesium that carry an electrical charge when dissolved in water. Our body gets these electrolytes from the food we eat and the fluid we drink. They help in performing various bodily functions like moving nutrients to the cells, moving waste out of cells, helping in rebuilding damaged tissues, balancing the body’s pH levels, and regulating the nerves, muscles, heart, and brain functionality, among other things.Water, generally, has these minerals infused in it but due to purification some of them might be lost. Also, when engaged in intense physical activity, like a workout, the body tends to lose electrolytes through sweat, along with when one becomes dehydrated, in case of diarrhoea or vomiting.As such, Rodriguez suggested adding electrolytes to water for better hydration. “You need electrolytes alongside water to be properly hydrated. Every time you pee, you are peeing out electrolytes that are sodium, potassium, and magnesium, and you are peeing out water. But most people are only replenishing with water. So the more you drink, the more you pee, the more you need electrolytes,” he shared.',

          content:'Amid a sudden surge in COVID-19 and flu (H3N2) cases, it has become imperative to take precautionary measures to stay healthy. Apart from ensuring to take the COVID-19 vaccine and also the preventive flu shots (after consulting an expert), it is also important to wear masks in public spaces — especially as everything has now opened up. But, with a plethora of masks available in the market — from surgical masks, cloth masks, N95, KN 95 among others — which mask provides the best protection? If you also have the same doubt (along with others), we have made things simpler for you by asking experts some questions like how to choose a mask for oneself, which one provides maximum protection, and when to discard the mask, among other things.In general, wearing masks is advisable to prevent the spread of all viral flu-like infections like COVID 19, H3N2 etc., from one person to another. “The spread of COVID 19 or H3N2 or any other respirable virus is, primarily, through airborne particles and droplets. Hence, any mask is better than no mask but it is critical that the masks should completely cover your nose and mouth, and should have a nose wire to prevent air leaking from the mouth,” Dr Gopi Krishna Yedlapati, Consultant Interventional Pulmonologist, Yashoda Hospitals Hyderabad, tells indianexpress.com.Both KN95 and N95 are very similar. N95 is the US standard and KN95 is the China standard. N95 and KN95 masks provide the highest protection, followed by surgical masks and cloth masks. Dr Yedlapati says that N95 masks are the most effective and can filter up to 95 percent of air particles, followed by KN95 (very similar protection), surgical masks, and cloth masks.',

          content:'Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor has been working really hard to achieve his fitness goals, and the results are definitely showing. As such, sharing a glimpse of his well-toned physique, the Kapoor scion revealed his high-energy HIIT or High-Intensity Interval Training workout with trainer Neal Drew.“HIIT workout with @DrewNealpt was mad today…10 sprints for 30 seconds each with 101 minute brisk walks super set with 50 jump squats and 50 jump pushups followed by 30 burpees, 30 crunches followed by 30 bench jumps and 30 medicine ball twists…all in 45 minutes…needed ice afterwards…” he shared.In another Instagram Story, he shared that the power workout session was followed by a sunset and a hot shower to complete hot and cold recovery. “Taking care of yourself can be fun and very rewarding,” he added, alongside a mirror selfie showing off his toned physique.HIIT workouts boost anaerobic capacity and muscular strength, and the steady-paced cardio exercises build endurance as they primarily rely on the oxidative energy system, explained Varun Rattan, co-founder of The Body Science Academy, Noida. “Aerobic refers to the body’s process of producing energy with oxygen. It includes all exercises that last more than two minutes. HIIT, on the other hand, is more suitable for individuals who want to produce maximum power in minimum time, such as sprints. Besides, those looking for a fast workout may be drawn to HIIT,” said Rattan.Stressing that such exercises also have an ‘after burn’ effect, registered dietitian Garima Goyal said, “You need more oxygen for recovery, which boosts the body’s metabolism and you burn more calories.”',

          content:'Inspired by soppressata and hot honey pizza, this baked fresh egg pasta dish starts with a harissa- and soppressata-laced tomato sauce. Using chopped soppressata in the sauce and sliced on top gives you a double dose of flavor. Lots of low-moisture mozzarella yields a gooey interior and well-browned top. Don’t have a 12-inch oven-and broiler-proof skillet? Transfer the mixture to a 9- x 13-inch broiler-safe baking pan before baking and broiling in step 4. Harissa is available at most grocery stores or online at nyshuk.com.Preheat oven to 425°F with rack 8 inches from heat. Finely chop half of the soppressata; very thinly slice remaining soppressata into thin rounds. Set aside. Cook oil and butter in a 12-inch broiler-safe skillet over medium until butter is melted and bubbling, 1 to 2 minutes. Add finely chopped soppressata, shallots, garlic, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, crushed red pepper, and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until soppressata is rendered and shallots are softened, about 3 minutes. Add harissa and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until sizzling and evenly combined, about 2 minutes. Add wine; cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from bottom of skillet, until nearly evaporated, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes. Transfer skillet to preheated oven, and roast until tomatoes start to burst, about 10 minutes.Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over high. Stir in grattini. Cook, undisturbed, until just al dente, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain pasta well, and spread on a large rimmed baking sheet; let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.Remove skillet from oven, and return to stovetop; do not turn oven off. Stir broth and chickpeas into mixture in skillet; bring to a simmer over medium. Stir in remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Gradually fold in cooked pasta and half of the shredded cheese (about 11/2 cups). Sprinkle pasta with remaining 11/2 cups cheese; arrange sliced soppressata over cheese.Return skillet to oven, and bake at 425°F until cheese is melted and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Increase oven temperature to broil (do not remove skillet from oven); broil until cheese is golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove skillet from oven; let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Garnish with crushed red pepper, basil leaves, and hot honey.',
